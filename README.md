# Netflix Movies and TV Shows Clustering

### Project Overview:

The objective of this project is to analyze and cluster a dataset related to Netflix. The dataset consists of various attributes associated with Netflix shows and movies, such as title, release year, duration, rating, and others. The aim is to explore patterns and similarities among the content available on the platform and group them into meaningful clusters.

To begin with, the dataset will be preprocessed by handling missing values, removing irrelevant columns, and transforming categorical variables into numerical representations. Feature engineering techniques may also be applied to extract useful information from the existing attributes.

Next, exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques will be utilized to gain insights into the dataset. Visualizations and statistical summaries will be used to understand the distribution of variables, identify any trends, and explore relationships between different features.

Once the dataset has been thoroughly analyzed, clustering algorithms such as k-means, hierarchical clustering, or density-based spatial clustering will be employed. These algorithms will group similar Netflix shows and movies together based on their attributes. The optimal number of clusters will be determined using techniques like the elbow method or silhouette analysis.

Finally, the findings and insights from the clustering analysis will be summarized and presented in a clear and concise manner. Visualizations, charts, and graphs will be used to effectively communicate the outcomes of the project. Recommendations may also be provided based on the identified clusters, suggesting potential improvements or strategies for Netflix to enhance user experience and content offerings.

In conclusion, this project aims to analyze a Netflix dataset, perform clustering techniques to group similar shows and movies together, and provide insights. The project will contribute to a better understanding of Netflix's content landscape and aid in decision-making processes for the company.
